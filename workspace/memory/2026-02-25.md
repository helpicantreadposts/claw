## Log
- 01:13 (GMT): Braden reported Video #1 (Teapot) lacked Reddit overlap.
- 01:15 (GMT): Investigated `back-end/src/generator/process/overlay.ts`. Found scrolly overlay was recorded at 1080x960 but overlayed without explicit scaling/padding in split-screen mode.
- 01:25 (GMT): Patched `createScrollyOverlay` to include `scale` and `pad` filters, ensuring the scrolly video fits the viewport properly.
- 01:30 (GMT): Initiated re-generation of Video #1 with the fix.
- 01:33 (GMT): Generation complete (ID: 62ae8229-b231-466b-bd5f-406587709993).
- 01:35 (GMT): Compressed fixed video and sent to Braden via Telegram for final review.
- 03:15 (GMT): Braden reported scrolly container obscured the background video too much.
- 03:20 (GMT): Captured mid-frame confirmation. Verified container was semi-transparent but full-height.
- 03:35 (GMT): Patched `createScrollyOverlay` in `overlay.ts` to:
    - Force opaque background (`rgba(26, 26, 27, 1.0)`).
    - Pin container to the top (`justifyContent: flex-start`, `paddingTop: 0`).
    - Round only bottom corners (`borderRadius: 0 0 24px 24px`).
- 03:50 (GMT): Re-generated and delivered Video #1 v4 (Fixed Split-Screen).
- 03:15 (GMT): Braden requested background visibility throughout the video (scrolly was covering full screen).
- 03:20 (GMT): Patched `overlay.ts` to force scrolly viewport to `height / 2` and added `minHeight: 100%` to body styling.
- 03:30 (GMT): Re-rendered Video #1 (ID: 30e8245b-f35a-454a-97f8-b5df17683f5d) and sent fixed preview to Braden.
