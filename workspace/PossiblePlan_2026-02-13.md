# PossiblePlan_2026-02-13.md - Strategy for Growth (Manual Recovery)

## 1. New Format Prototype: "Pause 2 See" (The Bed Roulette)
**Concept:** Rapidly cycle through unique 'Bed Vibes' (Royal, Messy, High-Tech, etc.).
**Execution:** 
- Fix `video-stitch-v3.js` bug (only showing one image).
- Ensure high-speed, frame-perfect replacement of 10 unique assets.
- Add intro/outro segments.
- **Goal:** Drive high re-watch metrics.

## 2. Content Niche for Today
**Primary:** r/tifu (Today I Fucked Up).
**Secondary:** r/AskReddit "Graveyard Secrets."

## 3. Technical Improvement: Scheduler Robustness
- Investigating why cron triggers were missed (likely timezone/heartbeat synchronization issues).
- Switching scheduler to "Direct Chat" notifications for better accountability.
