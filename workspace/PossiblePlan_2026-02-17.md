# Possible Plan - 2026-02-17

## 📈 Strategy Overview
Focusing on high-conflict family dynamics and embarrassing social failures, which are trending top on Reddit today.

## 🎥 Video #1 (Morning Shift)
- **Source:** r/AmITheAsshole
- **Hook:** "My granddaughter is in 4th grade and she struggles in reading... her tablet just reads it out loud. She isn’t even following along."
- **Story:** Grandma forces granddaughter to read physical books instead of using the "read-aloud" tablet app provided by the mom. DIL gets furious and accuses her of questioning her parenting.
- **Format:** Split Screen (Top: Reddit Post / Bottom: Minecraft Parkour)
- **SEO Title:** AITA for making my granddaughter actually read instead of using a tablet? #reddit #aitastories #familydrama

## 🎥 Video #2 (Evening Shift)
- **Source:** r/tifu
- **Hook:** "I have a f***ing beard of blood pouring down my face right before I'm supposed to meet up for a breakfast date!"
- **Story:** OP uses a cheap dollar store razor before a first date and cuts his face so badly he looks like a vampire. Has to run into the hotel hallway covered in blood to find ice, terrifying a maid.
- **Format:** Scrolly-Highlight (Vertical Reddit Clone)
- **SEO Title:** I turned into a HOTEL VAMPIRE before my date! #tifu #storytime #embarrassing

## 🛠 Experimental Goal
- **SEO Optimization:** Testing high-retention "Beard of Blood" hook for Video #2.
- **Background Rotation:** Using Slime/ASMR for the evening shift to avoid "repetitive content" flags.

## 📅 Schedule
- **08:15:** Send plan to Braden.
- **09:00:** Begin Generation of Video #1.
- **17:00:** Begin Generation of Video #2.
