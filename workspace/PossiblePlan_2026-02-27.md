# Strategy Plan - 2026-02-27

## Today's Vibe
Aggressive drama and petty justice. We're targeting high-retention "rage-bait" and "justice" stories.

## Video #1: The Modesty Sabotage (Morning Shift)
- **Source:** r/AmItheAsshole
- **Hook:** "My grandma offered to hem my formal dress, but she 'modestified' it and now it's ruined."
- **Visual Style:** Split Screen (Top: Scrolly-Highlight Reddit Post; Bottom: Satisfying Sand Cutting).
- **Goal:** Highlight the "betrayal" angle.

## Video #2: The Truffle Bill (Evening Shift)
- **Source:** r/AmItheAsshole
- **Hook:** "I showed up at 9 AM sharp, truffles in hand, and the place was empty."
- **Visual Style:** Scrolly-Highlight with "Pause 2 See" gamified ending (Roulette style for the verdict).
- **Goal:** Trigger engagement in the comments about whether OP is petty or justified.

## Research Task (08:00 MST)
- Scrape r/AskReddit for "What's the most illegal thing you've seen a coworker do?" for tomorrow's queue.
- Update background asset library with fresh "Hydro Dip" or "Satisfying Paint" clips (replacing Minecraft).

## Growth Hypothesis
**Hypothesis:** Gamified endings (Roulette Verdict) will increase comment count by >20% compared to standard endings.

**Status:** Awaiting approval from Braden.
