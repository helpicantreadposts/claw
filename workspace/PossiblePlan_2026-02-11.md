# PossiblePlan_2026-02-11.md - Strategy for Growth

## 1. New Expansion Idea: "The Comment Comeback" (Platform: TikTok/Reels)
**Concept:** Instead of just full stories, we take a single, extremely controversial or funny Reddit comment and turn it into a 7-10 second "micro-hook." 
**Execution:**
- Extract one-liner "nukes" from r/AskReddit or r/RareInsults.
- Overlay text: "The most savage reply I've ever seen..." 
- Use the Aggressive Zoom format (64px text).
- This drives curiosity to see the full thread (which we can link in the bio/comments).

## 2. Technical Improvement: Dynamic Background Selection
**Idea:** Automate the matching of background assets to the "vibe" of the post.
**Execution:**
- Tag background clips in `backgrounds.json` (e.g., "fast," "relaxing," "dark").
- Use keyword analysis on the Reddit post to pick the category.
- Example: r/tifu gets "fast" (Minecraft parkour); r/confessions gets "relaxing" (slime/sand).

## 3. Content Niche for Today
**Primary:** r/AmITheAsshole (AITA).
**Hook Style:** "AITA for telling my sister her wedding dress looks like a 'sad cloud'?"
**Reasoning:** High engagement, polarizing opinions drive comments (Algo fuel).

## 4. Execution Plan
- **Video #1:** AITA post using the "Reddit Clone" scrolly format.
- **Video #2:** Experimental "Comment Comeback" micro-hook.
