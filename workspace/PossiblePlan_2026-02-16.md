# Strategy Plan: 2026-02-16

## 🎬 Creative Direction: The "High-Stakes Hook" Pivot
Based on our current queue, we're shifting focus to **Immediate Conflict** hooks. No more "So this happened today..." intros. We start mid-explosion.

### Video #1: Morning Shift (AITA - Mommyjacking)
- **Source:** r/AmItheAsshole - "stop mommyjacking every conversation"
- **Hook:** "For once can a conversation be about me without you mommyjacking it?"
- **Format:** **Split Screen (Experimental).** Top: Reddit Screenshot + Word-Highlight. Bottom: High-speed Minecraft Parkour.
- **Narrative Edit:** Trim the job crisis context. Focus purely on the confrontation and the family fallout. Aim for 52 seconds.

### Video #2: Evening Shift (Pause 2 See / Gamified)
- **Concept:** Roulette-style "Pause to See Your Fate."
- **Execution:** Rapid-fire alternating frames of positive/negative outcomes based on the **TIFU (Rice Cooker)** story.
- **Hook:** "Pause to see if you survive the year-long stomach bug."
- **Format:** High-paced, flash-cut overlays.
