# Content Strategy and Viral Optimization - 2026-02-10

## 1. New Strategy: "Scrolly-Highlight" Optimization
### Concept
Instead of static text overlays, use a "scrolling" effect that highlights the sentence being read in real-time. This increases readability and keeps the viewer's eye moving, which improves retention.

### Execution Method
1. **Dynamic Text:** Generate a JSON of word-level timestamps from the TTS output.
2. **Visual Mapping:** Create a vertical scrolling "teleprompter" style overlay where the active sentence is bright/bold and the surrounding text is dimmed or blurred.
3. **Pacing:** Sync the scroll speed exactly with the reading rate to create a "karaoke" effect for the story.

## 2. Trending Research (Feb 10, 2026)
### Target Story
- **Subreddit:** r/AmItheAsshole

- **Hook:** 19-year-old valedictorian discovers mother spent his $7,000 inheritance and is now controlling his financial aid refund for a car he didn't want.
- **Why it will go viral:** Financial betrayal by parents, relatable struggle for independence, high rage-bait potential.

## 3. Asset Gathering Plan
### Background Assets
- **Type:** Minecraft Parkour or Satisfying Kinetic Sand.
- **Source:** Local repository or high-quality royalty-free sources.
- **Audio:** High-energy TTS (Adam) with dramatic pauses.

## 4. Production Schedule
