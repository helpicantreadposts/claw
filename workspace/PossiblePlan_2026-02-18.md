## 📈 Strategy Overview
Focusing on accidental physical comedy and social faux pas, which are high-engagement niches for Shorts.

## 🎥 Video #1 (Morning Shift)
- **Source:** r/AmITheAsshole
- **Hook:** "AITA for telling my wife that her 'emotional support' hobby is just an excuse to be lazy and messy?"
- **Story:** OP's wife picked up pottery as a 'mental health' hobby. Now the house is covered in clay and dust. OP told her it's just a mess and she's being lazy. She's now staying with her sister.
- **Format:** Split Screen (Top: Reddit Post / Bottom: Satisfying Sand Cutting)
- **SEO Title:** AITA for calling my wife's hobby a 'MESSY EXCUSE'? #reddit #aitastories #familydrama

## 🎥 Video #2 (Evening Shift)
- **Source:** r/tifu
- **Hook:** "I stabbed a lady (completely by accident) in her nostril with my pocket knife while trying to pop balloons on Valentine's day."
- **Story:** OP was at a concert, tried to help a lady pop balloons with a pocket knife, and accidentally stabbed her nostril. Everyone thought it was funny except OP, who was mortified.

## 🛠 Experimental Goal
- **Visual Diversity:** Using "Satisfying Sand Cutting" for the morning shift to test retention against Minecraft Parkour.
- **High Stakes Hooks:** Testing "I STABBED HER" as a curiosity gap hook for the evening shift.
