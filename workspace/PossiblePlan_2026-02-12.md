# PossiblePlan_2026-02-12.md - Strategy for Growth

## 1. New Expansion Idea: "The Visual Hook Audit" (Technical Improvement)
**Concept:** Instead of just text, we start incorporating "Visual Hooks" using Reddit avatars or relevant icons next to the usernames in the scrolly format. 
**Execution:**
- Update the `reddit-clone` template to pull the subreddit icon and user flair (if available).
- This increases the "official" feel of the video and improves trust/retention.

## 2. Technical Improvement: Scheduler Heartbeat Hardening
**Idea:** Ensure the scheduler never misses a MST trigger again by pinning the system clock to MST and adding a "Pre-Flight" check 5 minutes before every shift.
**Execution:**
- Update cron jobs to include a 5-minute "Wake Up" alert that pings the main session before the actual task starts.

## 3. Content Niche for Today
**Primary:** r/tifu (Today I Fucked Up).
**Hook Style:** "TIFU by accidentally becoming my boss's life coach."
**Reasoning:** Relatable, funny, and high-engagement.

## 4. Execution Plan
- **Video #1:** r/tifu post using the "Split Screen" format with Minecraft parkour.
- **Video #2:** r/AskReddit "Deep Secret" thread using the Scrolly-Highlight format.
