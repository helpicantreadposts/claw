# Possible Strategy Plan - 2026-02-24

## Theme: "Extreme Perspective"
The goal today is to lean into the "Scrolly-Highlight" format but with a more aggressive mobile-first zoom and high-contrast color palette to further improve retention.

### Morning Shift (09:00 MST) - Video #1
- **Subreddit:** r/AskReddit or r/AmITheAsshole
- **Format:** Scrolly-Highlight (Perfect Layout)
- **Background:** Satisfying Sand Cutting (Pink/Blue palette)
- **Goal:** Hook the viewer with a "Part 1" of a high-stakes emotional story.
- **SEO Focus:** "AITA for letting my sister's secret slip?" or "Reddit's Most Controversial Advice."

### Evening Shift (17:00 MST) - Video #2 (Experimental)
- **Subreddit:** r/confessions
- **Format:** Split Screen Insight (Top: Reddit / Bottom: Slime ASMR)
- **Experiment:** Add a "Pause to Read" frame at the 50s mark with a "Secret Hidden Detail" in the background to encourage rewatches and pauses.
- **Background:** High-retention Slime ASMR (Metallic/Neon colors)

### Automation Improvements
- **SEO Logic:** Test the new `seo.ts` integration to ensure tags and descriptions are generating high CTR keywords.
- **Background Rotation:** Verify that Video #1 and #2 use distinct visual categories to avoid repetition flags.
