# Strategy Plan - 2026-02-28

## Today's Vibe
Professional entitlement and relationship "tests." We're looking at scenarios where "doing your job" or "following orders" clashes with personal expectations.

## Video #1: The Caesar Sabotage (Morning Shift)
- **Source:** r/AmItheAsshole (u/unknown)
- **Hook:** "My boyfriend is a pastry chef and tried to serve me a 'Caesar Salad' stuffed in a tortilla because he forgot my order."
- **Visual Style:** Split Screen (Top: Scrolly-Highlight Reddit Post; Bottom: Satisfying Kinetic Sand).
- **Goal:** Drive comments on whether OP's boyfriend was being lazy or if OP was "causing a scene."

## Video #2: The Industry Secret (Evening Shift)
- **Source:** r/AskReddit (Trending)
- **Hook:** "I work in a 'behind closed doors' industry. Here is the one thing you'd be horrified to know."
- **Visual Style:** Aggressive Zoom (Large text) with a "Pause 2 See" gamified ending (Roulette style for the most horrifying secret).
- **Goal:** Drive curiosity and shares.

## Research Task (08:00 MST)
- Scrape r/tifu for "Monday Morning" horror stories for tomorrow's queue.
- Review "Hydro Dip" library performance vs. Kinetic Sand in `ANALYTICS.md`.

## Growth Hypothesis
**Hypothesis:** Relatable workplace drama performs 15% better on Saturdays when people are decompressing from their own jobs.

**Status:** Awaiting approval from Braden.
