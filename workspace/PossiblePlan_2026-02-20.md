## 🎥 Video #1: Morning Shift (AITA - Family/Education)
**Source:** r/AmItheAsshole - "AITA for telling my uncle I don’t want to be like his kids"
**Hook:** "My uncle calls me a spoiled brat because I go to private school and his kids are homeschooled... but his 10-year-old can't multiply single digits."
**Why it works:** High-stakes family conflict, academic contrast, and a clear "villain" (the uncle). Very relatable for Gen Z/Alpha audiences.
**Visual Style:**
