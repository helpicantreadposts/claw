# Possible Strategy Plan - 2026-02-25

## Theme: "High-Contrast Split"
Following yesterday's iterative improvements, today we solidify the "Opaque Top-Half Scrolly" layout. This format provides the best balance of readability and background visibility.

### Morning Shift (09:00 MST) - Video #1
- **Subreddit:** r/AmITheAsshole or r/confessions
- **Format:** Scrolly-Highlight (v4 Opaque Top-Half)
- **Background:** Satisfying Slime (Neon/Vibrant colors)
- **Goal:** Test the new opaque header clarity on a high-engagement relationship story.
- **Story Lead:** "AITA for charging my friend for the snacks she keeps sampling from my room?" (From yesterday's research).

### Evening Shift (17:00 MST) - Video #2 (Experimental)
- **Subreddit:** r/tifu
- **Format:** Split Screen (Top: Reddit / Bottom: ASMR Sand Cutting)
- **Experiment:** Implement a "Part 2" teaser overlay at the end to boost profile navigation.
- **Background:** Satisfying Sand Cutting (Multicolor).

### Automation & Stability
- **GOG Auth:** Still flagging as expired. I will proceed with creation and Telegram delivery until a refresh is possible.
- **Layout Validation:** Will capture a mid-render frame for Video #1 to ensure the opaque top-half is perfectly aligned.
